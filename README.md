## üåç About DecentraLabs
DecentraLabs is a community-driven initiative led by [Nebulous Systems](https://nebsyst.com/) in collaboration with international academic partners such as [UNED](https://www.uned.es/) and [Blockchain@UBC](https://blockchain.ubc.ca/). The project aims to redefine how online laboratories (OLs) are shared, accessed, and sustained across borders. By leveraging decentralized technologies (including smart contracts, token-based incentives, and federated authentication), DecentraLabs builds an open, interoperable, and sustainable infrastructure for scientific experimentation, education, and research and fosters an innovative ecosystem where knowledge is democratized and shared across global communities. All core components are open source and developed with transparency, inclusion, and public good in mind.

## üß™ DecentraLabs Marketplace
The DecentraLabs Marketplace is a decentralized platform where educational and research institutions, as well as original lab equipment manufacturers, can list their online laboratories, manage access conditions, and receive $LAB tokens as compensation for usage. At the same time, students, teachers, and researchers around the world can discover, reserve, and interact with real lab equipment remotely, using only a crypto wallet or institutional Single Sign-On (SSO).

Each lab can be offered for free or for a fee, at the discretion of the provider. Access is controlled via smart contracts and enforced through a secure, tokenized infrastructure. This ensures transparency, verifiability, and fair rewards for contributors; all without centralized intermediaries.

DecentraLabs Marketplace aims to offer a curated catalog of online laboratories shared by leading educational and research institutions worldwide. Whether you‚Äôre looking to publish underused lab systems or access cutting-edge infrastructure for remote experiments, the DecentraLabs Marketplace is your gateway to a global, decentralized network of scientific collaboration.

## Getting Started

This dApp is developed as a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project using the App Router.

First, install Next.js: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation

Then, install all dependencies required by the project using package.json:

```bash
npm install package.json
```

Once the framework and the dependencies are installed, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/layout.js` or `src/app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

DecentraLabs is a cutting-edge marketplace offering a curated catalog of online laboratories shared by leading educational and research institutions worldwide. This platform revolutionizes access to specialized laboratory environments, allowing users to reserve and interact with state-of-the-art resources via their digital wallets. Whether for academic research, hands-on training, or experimentation, laboratories can be made available either for free or for a fee, based on the provider's preferences. By leveraging decentralized technologies, DecentraLabs fosters an open, accessible, and innovative ecosystem where knowledge is democratized and shared across global communities.

DecentraLabs marketplace is developed as a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install Next.js: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation

Then, install all dependencies required by the project using package.json:

```bash
npm install package.json
```

Once the framework and the dependencies are installed, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/index.js` or `src/MarketPage.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

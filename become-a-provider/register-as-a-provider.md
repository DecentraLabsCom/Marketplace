# Register as a provider

### 🔭 Future Vision

In the long term, DecentraLabs aims to support **federated Single Sign-On (SSO)** for institutional providers. This would allow us to automatically recognize verified university or research staff based on identity provider credentials (e.g., via [eduGAIN](https://edugain.org/)), streamlining the onboarding process and reducing the risk of fraud. Additionally, we envision a **DAO-based governance model** in which the community collectively decides who can join as a provider, ensuring openness, fairness, and transparency in provider approval.

However, while these features are under development, the current provider registration process is handled manually and involves a simple but secure verification step performed by the DecentraLabs core team.

### 📝 Current Registration Process

At present, becoming a provider involves the following steps:

1. **Connect Your Wallet**\
   Navigate to the DecentraLabs Marketplace and connect your Web3 wallet. This address will be used to identify you on-chain and manage your future interactions with the platform.
2. **Submit a Registration Request**\
   After connecting your wallet, fill out the _Register as a Provider_ form available on the platform. You’ll be asked to provide basic information:
   * Wallet address (automatically filled)
   * Contact email
   * Institution or provider name
   * Country of operation
3. **Verification by the DecentraLabs Team**\
   The team at **Nebulous Systems** receives your registration request and performs a manual review. This may involve verifying your institutional affiliation or checking public records.
4. **Approval or Rejection**\
   Based on the review, your request will either be:
   * ✅ **Approved** – Your provider profile is **recorded on-chain** through our smart contracts, granting you access to provider-only features.
   * ❌ **Rejected** – You will be notified by email if the request is denied, along with any relevant reasoning or next steps.

Once approved, you will be able to proceed with publishing and managing your labs through the decentralized infrastructure.

> 💡 In future releases, this process will be streamlined and governed collectively. For now, it ensures trust and security as the ecosystem grows.

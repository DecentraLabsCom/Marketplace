# Become a Provider

Do you manage laboratories that could be leveraged by a wider community of students and researchers worldwide? Are you interested in securely sharing and possibly monetizing access to your lab equipment without complicated agreements or intermediaries? DecentraLabs makes it straightforward and secure.

Becoming a provider means joining a decentralized global network of institutions that share resources online, transparently and efficiently. You'll list your laboratories on the DecentraLabs marketplace, set your own access terms, and, if desired, receive compensation in $LAB tokens. Everything is automated via smart contracts (secure reservations, instant payments, token-based authentication and authorization), and complete transparency and traceability of lab usage.

All you need to start is a functioning, self-contained laboratory, undergo a simple institutional validation, and register your lab through our easy-to-use platform. Weâ€™ll guide you through the entire process.

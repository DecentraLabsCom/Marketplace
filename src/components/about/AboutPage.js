              DecentraLabs is a project by Nebsyst focused on creating decentralized remote labs. Our goal 
              is to provide a platform where users can access and utilize remote labs in a secure and 
              decentralized manner. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure that the labs are 
              accessible, transparent, and tamper-proof.
            </p>
            <p>
              DecentraLabs aims to revolutionize the way remote labs are accessed and utilized, making it 
              easier for individuals and organizations to conduct experiments, research, and training 
              without the need for physical presence.
